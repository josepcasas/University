This repository include some code (in Matlab, R and Stata) I have worked on during my master's program at BGSE.

### Independent Study Project

As part of the master's project we have to work in a small policy memo. We decided to study what would have happened to the GIIPS (Greece, Ireland, Italy, Portugal and Spain) if they had restructured their debt at different periods of the Financial Crisis.

The data folder constains the analysis (in R) long run analysis of real GDP growth for each of the countries. We need the mean and the standard deviation of yearly growth for the haircut (i.e. the share of debt that creditors do not get back) model.

The model folder constain the simulation of the CEPR (2015) model. The model calculates the size of the haircut for a given economy.
